            <p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented, and secure programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991. It is formally known as OAK. In 1995, Sun Microsystem changed the name to Java. In 2009, Sun Microsystem takeover by Oracle Corporation.</p>

                            <h2>OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System)</h2>
                            <p>Object-oriented programming is a way of solving a complex problem by breaking them into a small sub-problem. An object is a real-world entity. It is easier to develop a program by using an object. In OOPs, we create programs using class and object in a structured manner.</p>
                            <span><p></p><b>Class:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A class is a template or blueprint or prototype that defines data members and methods of an object. An object is the instance of the class. We can define a class by using the class keyword.</p></span>
                            <p><b>Object:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;An object is a real-world entity that can be identified distinctly. For example, a desk, a circle can be considered as objects. An object has a unique behavior, identity, and state. Data fields with their current values represent the state of an object (also known as its properties or attributes).</p>
                            <p><b>Abstraction:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;An abstraction is a method of hiding irrelevant information from the user. For example, the driver only knows how to drive a car; there is no need to know how does the car run. We can make a class abstract by using the keyword abstract. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.</p>
                            <p><b>Encapsulation:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;An encapsulation is the process of binding data and functions into a single unit. A class is an example of encapsulation. In Java, Java bean is a fully encapsulated class.</p>
                            <p><b>Inheritance:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inheritance is the mechanism in which one class acquire all the features of another class. We can achieve inheritance by using the extends keyword. It facilitates the reusability of the code.</p>
